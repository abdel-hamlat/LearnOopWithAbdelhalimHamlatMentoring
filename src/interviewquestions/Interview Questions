// What is string? : string is a data type

			// What is public?: public is the access modifier

			// What does void ?mean : void is the keyword

			// what is main method ?: The main() is the starting point for JVM to start execution of a Java program. Without the main() method, JVM will not execute the program. The syntax of the main() method is: public: It is an access specifier.

			// Interview question: why java recognize main ? because JVM has this name setup over there

			// public static halim (){   in this case JVM does not understand what does halim mean

			// why its call main method??

			// can we change the Main method name ?? yes we can change it by using mechanism( configure it).

			// how we can call a non static variable inside main method?

	        // what is class ? is a prototype that define a variables and methods

	        // what is object ?
            // can we create multiple object of same class??


	// intellij questions
    	// what is Finally and finalize
    	// difference between abstract and interface
    	// what is the difference between the type of polymorphism
    	   There are two types of polymorphism in Java:
                   1. compile-time polymorphism/ (method overloading)/ static binding
                   2. runtime polymorphism /(method overriding)/ Dynamic binding


    //Whats the difference between ArrayList and LinkedList
        ArrayList Vs Linked List
        >>Manipulation with ArrayList is slow because it internally uses an array. If any element is removed from the array, all the bits are shifted in memory.
        >>Manipulation with LinkedList is faster than ArrayList because it uses a doubly linked list, so no bit shifting is required in memory.

        >> An ArrayList class can act as a list only because it implements List only.
        >> LinkedList class can act as a list and queue both because it implements List and Deque interfaces.

        >> ArrayList is better for storing and accessing data.
        >> LinkedList is better for manipulating data.
